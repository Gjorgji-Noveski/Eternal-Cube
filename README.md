"Eternal Cube" is a simple game made using the Pygame library in python. This project is a hobby of mine which i developed in my free time.

Goal of the game:
- Achieve the highest score you can

Controls:
- ↑ and ↓ arrow keys

Red and green platforms will spawn from the right side of the screen, by pressing the up or down arrow keys they will move until they are touching the top or bottom part of the player cube respectively. The player can lose if they glide on a red platform instead of a green one and also if they haven't pressed any key when the platforms are near them. Every couple of seconds the speed at which platforms move will increase.

That's pretty much it, hope you have fun with it !
